# SharpSwords
A C# text based adventure platform. This is designed for the creation of potentially cross-platform text based adventures. By decoupling the core application logic from the UI, we enable the creation of new UI projects for other platforms that are really just veneers over the same core code.

## Projects
There are multiple projects within the repository:

* SharpSwords - the core project containing most of the shared application logic.
* SharpSwords.Windows - a Windows Forms-based UI for native Windows SharpSwords apps.
